# SentimentAnalysis_Prac

The goal of text analysis is to quantify text to capture and analyze all possible meanings embedded in a text.

In this project, I'm working with the Unabomber Manifesto text, a famous 35,000-word essay by Ted Kaczynski, published in 1995. 
It contends the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the adaptation of humans to machinery.

After cleaning the data, I'm showing a comparable graph displaying positive and negative sentiment across each segment.
